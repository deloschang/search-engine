<h2>Dartmouth Internet Security Testbed (DIST)</h2>

DIST is an <a href="http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu">ISTS</a>-funded
project, operated in cooperation with Kiewit Computing
Services, that concerns itself with studying campus network usage patterns and
with developing systems for automatically detecting malicious attempts
to disrupt or degrade the network.
To support these activities, DIST has been installing
<em>wireless monitors</em> at various locations
around the campus.
<p>

The DIST wireless monitors look a lot like the Kiewit <em>access
points</em> that are deployed around the campus to support wireless
Internet access at Dartmouth.  In fact, both the Kiewit access points
and the DIST wireless monitors are Aruba AP70s, and they differ only in the
way they are deployed.
<p>

One of the differences is physical:  the Kiewit access points have no
external antennas (they transmit and receive through antennas embedded in
their antenna flaps), while the DIST wireless monitors are deployed with
twin blade antennas mounted at their sides.  A few of the DIST wireless
monitors are mounted with their flaps closed.  
Another difference, albeit an
invisible one, lies in the software that is deployed on these devices.
The Kiewit access points run proprietary Aruba software for managing
communication on a wireless network; if you have a laptop computer or
other wireless device and are within range of a Kiewit access point,
you can associate with it and use it to access the Internet.  By
contrast, the DIST wireless monitors run our own research software, which
monitors wireless network traffic with the goal of detecting anomalies
that suggest malicious activity.  The DIST wireless monitors play no direct
role in supporting Internet communication, and your laptop cannot associate
with them.

Each DIST wireless monitor is deployed with a label that reads DIST-XXX,
where XXX is a three-digit number.  These labels help the DIST project
to identify individual DIST wireless monitors in case any problems or
questions arise in connection with them.
