The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important family
of algorithms in applied and computational mathematics. These are the
algorithms that make most of signal processing, and hence  modern
telecommunications possible. The most basic divide and conquer approach
was originally discovered by Gauss  for the efficient interpolation of
asteroidal orbits. Since then, various versions of the algorithm have
been discovered and rediscovered many times, culminating with the
publishing of  Cooley and Tukey's landmark paper,
"An algorithm for machine calculation of complex Fourier series", 
Math. Comp. 19 (1965), 297--301. Nice historical surveys are

<P>
There are many ways to approach the FFT. The point of view of the work
collected here is a group theoretic one. In this setting the FFT is a family
of algorithms for the efficient expansion of a function defined on a finite
or compact group in terms of a set of irreducible matrix coefficients for
the group. For the circle these are precisely the exponentials or sampled
exponentials in the case of the discrete circle. Consideration of
noncommutative groups gives rise to the many families of special functions,
the most familiar of which are probably the Legendre functions and other
Gegenbauer polynomials and systems of orthogonal polynomials.

<P>
We assume that initially, the function is "given" as a finite set of
sample values on the group in question - in the classical setting the group
is the circle (discrete or continuous) and is usually identified with time
or space - and the forward Fourier transform consists in the computation
of the Fourier coefficients for the expansion of the function in terms of
a predetermined set of irreducible matrix coefficients on the group. Of course
the assumption is that these are finite expansions, and this effectively 
defines the general notion of "bandlimited" as a function with finite 
expansion in terms of irreducible matrix coefficients.

a loosely knit group of us have been working on different aspects of the
development and application of these algorithms. Here are some of us:

At present (June 1999) our work mainly falls into two categories: 

<UL>
<LI> (1)  Fast spherical harmonic expansions: a brief description
may be found <a href="#FFT_2Sphere"> here</a>; preprint and software
available <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~geelong/sphere/"> here</a>.
<LI> (2) FFTs for finite groups, especially the symmetric groups
and their wreath products and the special linear groups over finite
fields. Links to relevant publications may be found

<A NAME="FFT_2Sphere"><H3>FFTs for the 2-sphere</H3></A>

An FFT for the 2-sphere is defined to be an efficient algorithm for the 
expansion of a bandlimited function on the 2-sphere in terms of spherical 
harmomics. This falls into our framework by considering such functions as 
right SO(2)-invariant functions on the group SO(3). 

A function on the 2-sphere has bandwidth B if its expansion requires 
only spherical harmonics of order at most B. This implies at most B^2 
Fourier coefficients, which if computed directly (using an appropriate 
sampling theorem) requires on the order of (B^2)^2 = B^4 operations. In 
1989 Driscoll and Healy discovered a B^2\log^2(B^2) algorithm by using the 
three-term recurrence satisfied by the Legendre functions 
(J. R. Driscoll and D. Healy, "Computing Fourier transforms 
and convolutions on the 2-sphere", Proc. 34th IEEE FOCS, (1989) 344--349
(extended abstract);  Adv. in Appl. Math., 15 (1994), 202--250).  
A later reformulation of the algorithm gives a reduction of the inverse 
transform to an algorithm of the same order of complexity 
(D. Healy, P. Kostelec, S. Moore, and D. Rockmore, 
"Efficiency and reliability issues in a fast Fourier transform on the 
2-sphere", Technical Report, Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth 
College, 1994). We are currently working to obtain effective 
implementations of these ideas. A preprint describing algorithms
for computing Fourier transforms of tensor fields on the 2-sphere
can be found <A HREF="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~geelong/publications">
here</A>.

<a name="FFT_Finitegps"><H3>FFTs for finite groups</H3></a>

An FFT for a finite group is an efficient algorithm for
computing the expansion of a function in terms of irreducible
matrix coefficients. Direct computation of such an expansion
(from the input of sample values) would require |G|^2 operations.
It is <A HREF="dimacs-0.ps"> conjectured </A> that there 
is an O( |G| log^c |G|) upper bound for all groups G. To date,
this is known to be true for commutative groups, symmetric groups
and their wreath products, as well as supersolvable groups.

The <A HREF="sov-i.ps"> "separation of variables" </A> 
approach unifies most of the fast algorithms within a general framework.

For applications, we are particularly interested in implementations
of FFTs for symmetric groups (useful for the analysis of
ranked data), <A HREF="nwr0.ps"> wreath products </A>
(useful for analysis of data from experimental designs and 
image processing) and SL_2(F), for F a finite field (useful for 
<A HREF="stec.ps"> coding theory </A>).
