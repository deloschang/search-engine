LIKE PEOPLE IN MOST FIELDS, scientists take great pride in what they do.
It is hard work to design and perform a good experiment, collect and
analyze the data, and scrutinize the results to see if they have
implications beyond the scope of the experiment. After that long and
demanding process, it is natural for researchers to feel almost as if
they own their data. Those proprietary feelings can be especially
intense when other scholars want to mine the data for publication; after
all, publishing is the stuff of which academic careers are made.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Nevertheless, in recent years scholars in a variety of scientific fields
have begun to realize that data ought to be shared. The benefits are
many: History shows that shared databases speed the development of the
disciplines that use them. Recent advances in informatics-or data
mining-make it possible to use databases as primary research material.
The resulting meta-analyses give researchers ideas for new experiments,
cut down on duplication of effort, and allow researchers from other
disciplines to work in the field. That last benefit is crucial, for we
live at a time when scientific progress almost requires
interdisciplinary effort, and giving researchers from many fields access
to primary data is an essential component of interdisciplinary teaching
and research.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The most famous collection of shared data belongs to the Human Genome
Project. Although at first many researchers wanted nothing to do with a
shared database, it quickly became apparent that the results of the
project should be made available to everyone, because the new
information about DNA would have so many ramifications for the practice
of medicine. Now it is standard procedure for scientists to deposit
their data in the database, known as GenBank. Molecular biologists have
used its material to increase our knowledge enormously.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
In fact, the success of GenBank led scientists-including some of those
who initially objected to it-to call on the National Institutes of
Health to develop a new public database. Called Gene Expression Omnibus,
the new database makes available the increasing amount of data that
researchers are now producing on the expression of genes, the process
that translates genetic code at the molecular level into characteristics
like eye and hair color or right-handedness. Scientists began adding
material to GEO, as it is known, last fall.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Other fields with shared databases have also experienced the pattern of
initial reluctance followed by acceptance and excitement, accompanied by
significant increases in researchers' understanding of the subject.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The field of X-ray crystallography provides an example. Richard J.
Roberts, a 1993 Nobel laureate, first urged the creation of a shared
database for the discipline. The idea was eventually endorsed by the
American Crystallographic Association, the N.I.H., and the Protein
Society. Science magazine decided to require its contributors in the
field to deposit their X-ray-crystallographic coordinates in a public
database, but allowed the contributors to wait for a year after
publication before meeting the requirement. Although companies
interested in commercially exploiting the data supported the delay,
academic scientists wanted quicker access to the information. Now, both
Science and Nature require contributors in the field to deposit their
material in the database on publication.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We have been involved in the creation of a shared database in the field
of cognitive neuroscience, whose goal is to understand the nature of
thought by examining images of brain activity under a range of
circumstances and conditions. Together with other neuroscientists,
computer scientists, and mathematicians, we decided to form the National
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Center.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Functional-brain imaging is a new technology that allows researchers to
see the brain in action as it tackles various cognitive, perceptual, and
attentional operations. Unlike older technologies, this imaging has the
potential to reveal the neural landscapes generated by thought
processes, and the biochemical mechanisms that underlie emotions. But
each experiment using functional-brain imaging can produce up to 10
gigabytes of data, and until recently it was not possible to manage and
manipulate such a massive amount of raw data from experiments relying on
the images.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Like molecular geneticists and crystallographers, scientists using
brain-imaging technology initially reacted with panic to the idea of
sharing their data. Last summer, those of us involved in creating the
database sent a letter to the authors who had published
functional-imaging studies in the <I>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</I> the
year before. The letter invited them to deposit their data in the
database. It also stated that for subsequent articles, the journal would
require authors to do so. At that point, a few other leading journals
had also agreed to require their authors to contribute to the database.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Scientists who were opposed to the database asked the journals' editors
not to impose the requirement. Many of the editors thereupon backed off
from the policy that we had negotiated with them, even though most of
them already required authors to make all of the data published in those
journals available to the public. That is, in fact, the legal
requirement if the government has supported the research.

<P ALIGN="left">
WHEN the controversy erupted, we had already received funds, from the
National Science Foundation and the W M. Keck Foundation, to help set up
the brain-imaging database. We had begun to hire key personnel, buy the
requisite hardware and software, and develop a database that works. The
database, accessible to the public, contains information from more than
a dozen experiments that were reported in a special issue of the Journal
of Cognitive Neuroscience, and that were conducted at leading
laboratories in the United States and Europe. That special issue began
the journal's new policy of requiring authors to deposit material in the
database.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The dust now seems to be settling. We have tried to correct
misunderstandings
about the nature of the database. Indeed, many scientists recently have
urged us to expand our services. Some feel that an author should make
the data in a scientific paper available for inspection while the paper
is still being considered for publication.
</P>


<P ALIGN="left">
Our hope is that the database will lead to major scientific advances,
including new insights into cognitive physiology. Researchers working on
one of the brain's functions will be able to look at other scientists'
experiments for clues about what regions of the brain might be involved.
Universities that cannot afford an expensive brain-imaging center will
nonetheless have access to data for teaching and research.

Grand dreams are behind the best of science-dreams of knowing the
origins of the universe, say, or the secrets of human development. But
dreams are not enough. Eventually, any scientific theory needs to be
confirmed or revised by experimentation, and it is often the case that
the grander the theory or dream, the more data the investigation
produces. Recent history shows that making the totality of information
available to anyone who is interested is the most efficient means to
scientific ends.
