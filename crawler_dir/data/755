<B>Why did a magician become a mathematician?
How can a person see in four dimensions? 
What does a mathematical proof have in common with a Picasso
portrait? "The Math Life" brings to life the human dimension 
of mathematics through lively interviews with Freeman Dyson, David Mumford, 
Ingrid Daubechies,   Persi Diaconis, Michael Freedman, Fan Chung Graham, 
Kate Okikiolu, Jennifer Tour Chayes, 
Peter Sarnak, Steven Strogatz, and seven other mathematicians. These captivating luminaries vividly communicate the excitement and wonder that fuel their
 work as they explore the world through its patterns, shapes, motions, and
probabilities. 
Computer animations and analogies drawn from the visual arts are 
incorporated, to maximize accessibility to the fascinating concepts discussed. A Wendy Conquest/Bob Drake/Dan Rockmore Production.
