When Dartmouth switched to the new forms, I was thrown right 
into the mess: since I was Dartmouth liaison to a number of external colleagues who were in the process of filing expenses, and were very confused.
<p>
Here's what I've worked out.   (And a big shout-out to Tracy Flynn-Scott,
Mary Wood, and Tammy Chapin for their help here.  Especially Tracy, since I'm not even her department!)
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Accounts and Forms</h2>
<hr>
<p>
As before, there are "Travel Forms" (for travel) and "Request for
Payment" forms (for other types of expenses).  However, under the new system,
there are <i>two sets</i> of these:
<ul>
<li> One for "grant" accounts (e.g., NSF).   These live under the 
tuber-invoking acronym "PTAEO."
<li> One for non-grant accounts (e.g., IRR).  These live under the
name "General Ledger."
</ul>
If you're not sure, ask your local Grant Wizard.  (E.g., industry
sponsorship can be a bit ambiguous.)
<p>
The different sets live in different places on the Dartmouth web site.
<p>
I've collected the forms in one place and tried to set up the print area
and pagination to be sane.  Enjoy:
<ul>
<li> <a href="grant-te2.xls"><b>grant-te2.xls</b></a>
<li> <a href="grant-rfp.xls"><b>grant-rfp.xls</b></a>
<li> <a href="nongrant-te2.xls"><b>nongrant-te2.xls</b></a>
<li> <a href="nongrant-rfp.xls"><b>nongrant-rfp.xls</b></a>
</ul>
(I revised the TE forms in August 2008 to reflect updated mileage rates.)
<p>

<h2>Zillion-digit "Chart Strings"</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://oracle-dev.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/dartof.dc_account_lookup.lookup"><b>Here</b></a> is a Dartmouth page that
will convert the old account codes into very long "chart strings."   
(This might require authentication, and thus not be accessible to non-Dartmouth folks.)
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Travel Forms</h2>
<hr>
<p>
These are the most puzzling.  (As a colleague from CMU pointed out,
they go "both forwards and backwards.")
<p>
<ul>
<li> Go to the "Summary" sheet.  
<ul>
<li> Fill out your name and such on the top.  
<li> For the "T" number (on the top right), enter your initials and the date of the first expense.  (E.g., "SWS080407.")
<li> Go down to the bottom, and fill out your name, title, date in the "approval" part.
<li> If you feel ambitious, you might go down to the first line
of the big chart and enter the  zillion-character account code, 
to indicate to your Grant Wizard where you want the charges to go.
</ul>
<li> Then, go to the first "Supplemental Worksheet."  
<ul>
<li> Fill out your travel costs, as with the old forms.   
<li> BUT....  if you booked things like airfare or Dartmouth Coach through 
College Travel, don't enter it on this page!  Even though it tells you to enter "airfare" here.
<li> If your travel spills to more than one week, then go to additional "Supplemental Worksheets."
</ul>
<li> Then, go back to the "Details" page.
<ul>
<li> If you have direct-billed expenses (such as airfare or bus via College Travel), enter them on the bottom section here.
<li> If you need to add annotations to explain things on your supplemental worksheet (e.g., "Dinner on Day 4 covered all the other Dartmouth personnel too, but no alcohol"), add them here as well.
</ul>
<li> Then print it out and sign it.  (You should print out all the pages
on which you entered something.   I've tried to set up the pages and print
area appropriately; select "Print" from the drop-down menu, "Entire Workbook,"
and then whatever page range, usually 1 to 3.)
</ul>
<p>
If you have foreign travel that requires currency conversion...  good luck.   (I haven't had to deal with that yet.)
<p>
<hr>
<h2>But my external colleague sent in an old travel form!</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Try filling out the new form, and for "signature" 
add the note "see old-style travel form, attached."   That's worked for me.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>"Request for Payment" Forms</h2>
<hr>
<p>
These are simpler.    For the "RS" number, use your initials and date
of first purchase (e.g,, "SWS080408.")
