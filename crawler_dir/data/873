<h1> Books by Faculty </h1>


<h2 class="break">Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition</h2>

	<img src="books/intro_to_algorithms_3.jpg" border="1" alt="Introduction to Algorithms" title="Introduction to Algorithms">
	
	<p> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/">Tom Cormen</a>, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Cliff Stein
	
	
	<p>Available from <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/">MIT Press</a> | ISBN: 978-0-262-03384-8

<p>Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

<p>The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, and substantial additions to the chapter on recurrences (now called "Divide-and-Conquer"). It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new exercises and problems have been added for this edition.

	<p>
	Whether you're a security practitioner, developer, manager, or
	administrator, this book will give you the deep understanding
	necessary to meet today's security challenges--and anticipate
	tomorrow's. Unlike most books, <em>The Craft of System Security</em>
	doesn't just review the modern security practitioner's toolkit: It
	explains why each tool exists, and discusses how to use it to
	solve real problems.

<h2 class="break">Mathematical Mind-Benders</h2>

	<p> Peter Winkler's at it again.  Following the enthusiastic
	reaction to <a href =
	"http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=2019">Mathematical
	Puzzles:  A Connoisseur's Collection</a>, Peter has compiled a new
	collection of elegant mathematical puzzles to challenge and
	entertain the reader.  The original puzzle connoisseur shares
	these puzzles, old and new, so that you can add them to your own library.
	<p>
	This book is for lovers of mathematics, lovers of puzzles, lovers
	of a challenge.  Most of all it's for those who think that the
	world of mathematics is orderly, logical, and intuitive &ndash;
	and are ready to learn otherwise!

<h2 class="break"> Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</h2>

	<p> Available from <a href="http://www.keycollege.com/catalog/titles/discrete_mathematics.html">Key College Publishing </a> | ISBN: 1-930190-86-7
	
	<p> Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science covers most of the mathematical topics needed by computer scientists: basic combinatorics and graph theory, probability, logic and  proof techniques (including proof by induction), recurrence relationships and their solution, and the number theory needed to understand the RSA encryption scheme.  The examples are drawn from Computer Science.  Probability is used to analyze hashing and the average run times for algorithms.  Recurrence relations arise from the analysis of recursive algorithms.  Trees (including binary search trees) are a focus of the graph theory, and their properties are often proved using induction.

<h2 class="break"> Stalking the Riemann Hypothesis: The Quest to Find the Hidden Law of Prime Numbers </h2>

	<p>
	A non-technical account of the history of the Riemann Hypothesis,
	a 150 year-old unsolved math problem, whose solution gets to the
	heart of out understanding of the way in the which the prime
	numbers are distributed among the integers.
	
<h2 class="break"> Trusted Computing Platforms: Design and Applications </h2>

	<img src="books/tcp_cover.jpg" border="1" alt="Trusted Computing Platforms" title="Trusted Computing Platforms">
	
	<p> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws">Sean Smith</a>
	
	<p> Available from <a href="http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,4-102-22-36520721-0,00.html?changeHeader=true"> Springer</a> | ISBN: 0387239162

	
	<p>How can one trust computation taking place at a remote site, particularly if a party at that site might have 	motivation to subvert this trust? In recent years, industrial efforts have advanced the notion of a "trusted 	computing platform" as a building block. Through a conspiracy of hardware and software magic, these platforms 	attempt to solve this remote trust problem, to preserve various critical properties against various types of 	adversaries. However, these current efforts are just points on a larger continuum, which ranges from earlier 	work on secure coprocessor design and applications, through TCPA/TCG, to recent academic developments. Without 	wading through stacks of theses and research literature, the general computer science reader cannot see this 
	big picture.</p>
	
	<p>Trusted Computing Platforms: Design and Applications fills this gap. Starting with early prototypes and 
		proposed applications, this book surveys the longer history of amplifying small amounts of hardware 
		security into broader system security---and reports real case study experience with security architecture 
		and applications on multiple types of platforms. The author examines the theory, design, implementation of 
		the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor platform and discusses real case study applications that exploit the unique 
		capabilities of this platform. The author discusses how these foundations grow into newer industrial 
		designs, and discusses alternate architectures and case studies of applications that this newer hardware can 
		enable. The author closes with an examination of more recent cutting-edge experimental work in 
		this area.</p>

<h2 class="break">Topology for Computing</h2>

	href="http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521836662">Cambridge
	University Press</a> | ISBN: 0521836662
	
	<p> Written by a computer scientist for computer scientists, this book teaches topology from a computational point of view, and shows how to solve real problems that have topological aspects involving computers. Such problems arise in many areas, such as computer graphics, robotics, structural biology, and chemistry. The author starts from the basics of topology, assuming no prior exposure to the subject, and moves rapidly up to recent advances in the area, including topological persistence and hierarchical Morse complexes. Algorithms and data structures are presented when appropriate.

	<p>
	This timely and state-of-the-art topic is covered comprehensively
	in this book. Providing a complete and in-depth mathematical
	coverage of the topic - linear, generalized linear, and nonlinear
	mixed models, along with diagnostics - the book has dual appeal as
	both a graduate-level text and a reference. Special attention is
	given to algorithms and their implementations and several
	appendices make the text self-contained.

The first edition became the standard reference for professionals and a widely used text in universities worldwide. The second edition features new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming, as well as extensive revisions to virtually every section of the book. In a subtle but important change, loop invariants are introduced early and used throughout the text to prove algorithm correctness. Without changing the mathematical and analytic focus, the authors have moved much of the mathematical foundations material from Part I to an appendix and have included additional motivational material at the beginning.

	<p> Matthew Dickerson and <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~scot">Scot Drysdale</a>

	<p> Available from <a href="http://www.comap.com/product/?idx=179">COMAP</a>
			
	<p> This book is part of COMAP's Geometry and its Applications series. Books in this series are designed to give high-school students a richer understanding of mathematical concepts at the heart of geometry and the ways that applications of geometry affect their lives. It introduces the Voronoi diagram and uses it to solve a series of proximity problems that arise in running a chain of pizza parlors (deciding which parlor is closest to the location where a pizza is to be delivered, deciding where to locate a new parlor that is farthest away from existing parlors, finding for each parlor which other parlor is nearest to it).
