<h2>Course description</h2> 

<p>This course introduces programming techniques necessary to generate
interactive visual art on a computer. Although it briefly covers
computer-generated media art, the course focuses on the programming
skills required for creating <em>interactive</em> works. Rather than
using commercial software, students write their own programs to create
compositions with which users can interact. The course introduces
fundamental concepts of how to represent and manipulate color,
two-dimensional shapes, images, motion, and video. Coursework includes
short programming assignments to practice the concepts introduced
during lectures and projects to explore visual compositions. The
course assumes no prior knowledge of programming.</p>

<p>We'll be using a language called <a
href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

<h2>Coursework and grading</h2>

<p>Coursework will include:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Homeworks (~weekly; 50% total)</dt>
  <dd>To help you learn and practice the basic techniques.  Done individually.</dd>
  <dt>Projects (two; 25% total)</dt>
  <dd>To allow you to synthesize the material to do something bigger of your own design.  Done individually or with a partner.</dd>
  <dt>Quizzes (two; 25% total)</dt>
  <dd>To give a quick check-up on your understanding of the material.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Homework and project assignments are to be turned in via <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/">Blackboard</a>
<em>before</em> class on the due date, and must be accompanied by a
hard copy turned in at the start of class.  Ample time is provided for
each assignment, so in general, late submissions will not be accepted.
Under extenuating circumstances (prolonged illness, death in the
family, etc.), arrangements must be made with the instructor
<em>before</em> the due date.</p>

<p>Grades will be assessed according to correctness and quality of
both the <em>product</em> (does it look and act like it should?) and
the <em>code</em> (is it well-organized and easy to follow, does it
effectively use the proper programming constructs?).  For
exceptionally creative and interesting work, it is possible to receive
extra credit points.  Extra credit is tabulated separately from the
regular grades on homework and exams, and is used to adjust final
grades after the final average is computed.  Thus extra credit is
always optional, and not doing any extra credit work will never reduce
your final grade, even if everyone else in the class does a lot of
extra credit.</p>

<a name="honor"></a>
<h2>Honor code</h2>

<p>Dartmouth's honor code applies to this course, and academic
misconduct policies will be strictly enforced.  If you have questions,
ask!</p>

<p>You may discuss the homework with other current CS2 students, but
your submitted homework must be entirely your own.  As part of a
discussion, you may show (in person) another student your work.
However, your code and any other solutions you submit must be created,
written/typed, and documented by you alone.  You may not copy anything
directly from another student's work.  For example, copying a portion
of someone else's solution onto a piece of paper would violate the
honor code, even if you eventually turn in a different answer.
Similarly, e-mailing a portion of your code to another student, or
posting it on-line for them to see would violate the honor code.
Although all students must create and type in their own code, you may
help other students debug their programs once you and they have
already written your programs.  We do encourage discussion of homework
assignments between students, subject to these rules.  Note that
discussion between two students will be most useful when both students
have already made serious attempts to solve the problem on their
own.</p>

<p>If you make use of any code taken from outside references -- for
instance, from an off-site web page or a textbook other than the ones
used for this course -- you must clearly attribute the source of the
code with clear comments in the code that you submit.  Code from class
examples or the course textbook does not have to be attributed.  You
do not need to acknowledge discussion with other students on your
submitted work.  Proper respect for copyright laws as applied to
printed materials and software products is subsumed by Dartmouth
College's <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/policies/">Computing
Policies</a>.</p>

<p>On quizzes, you may not collaborate with, copy from, or otherwise
share information with anyone.  (You may of course ask questions of
the course staff.)</p>

<a name="access"></a>
<h2>Disabilities</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see the instructor before the end of the second week of
the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility
Services</a> office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.</p>
