<p><b>PRESS COVERAGE:</b> December 2006 article in <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/120706-intelligent-scaleable-wlan-defense-darpa.html"><img src="img/nwlogo-06.gif" alt="network world"></img></a></p>

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>
        With the rise of Voice over
    wireless LAN (VoWLAN), any complete WiFi security solution must address
    denial of service attacks, such as kicking off other clients, consuming
    excessive bandwidth, or spoofing access points, to the detriment of
    legitimate clients. Even an authorized client may be able to sufficiently
    disrupt service quality to make the network ineffective for legitimate
    clients.</p>

    <p> We take a three-point, <i>MAP (Measure, Analyze, Protect)</i>
    approach to develop an integrated and extensible framework to
    address existing and future attacks on WiFi networks.
    Specifically, we focus our efforts on an integrated set of new
    components that allow a WiFi network operator to measure and
    analyze WiFi and VoWLAN activity, and in real-time to identify and
    defend against MAC-layer attacks on that infrastructure.
    Our plan includes three overlapping phases: research, prototype
    development, and deployment on a large portion of Dartmouth's
		campus-wide wireless network.</p>
    
    <p><b>Measurement:</b> we have developed novel and scalable techniques to
    collect multi-channel MAC-layer traces of the wireless
    environment, building on our wireless-measurement infrastructure. Our
		independant and coordinated channel sampling strategies dynamically
		adapt to current channel conditions. These are augmented by our refocusing
		mechanism which takes input from the analysis engines to further improve
		relevant frame capture.

    </p>

    <p><b>Analysis:</b> We have developed novel anomaly and signature detection
		techniques. Our MAC spoofing detection algorithm is based on RSSI observed at
		the air monitors.
    </p>

    <p><b>Protection:</b> we will develop a
    policy-driven protection engine that leverages existing defense mechanisms;
    the R&amp;D challenge here is to integrate them into our analysis framework
    and to evaluate the impact of automated defenses on well-behaved users in a
    network.</p>

    <div class="bodybold">Deployment</div>
    <p>With our partner, <a
        href="http://www.arubanetworks.com/">Aruba Networks</a>, we
    will develop and deploy prototypes for testing in Phase 1-2, and
    in the third phase we are deploying our prototypes across
    Dartmouth' next-generation campus-wide WiFi network; this testbed
    provides valuable data for the research team and valuable input
    into Aruba's product pipeline.</p>

    <div class="bodybold">Novelty</div>
    <p>We plan significant, novel extensions to existing
    technology; these techniques have never been applied to WiFi
    networks, to VoWLAN applications, or at the scale necessary for
    large deployment. Our integrated end-to-end MAP approach is new,
    and our proposed campus-wide deployment is unprecedented in scope
    and scale.</p>
    
    <p>Our MAP approach provides a new foundation for wireless network
    security, able to dynamically measure, analyze and protect a WiFi
    network against existing and novel threats, including rogue
    clients and access points, with a focus on VoWLAN use cases.</p>
