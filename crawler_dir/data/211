<h1> M.S. Admissions</h1>

<h2 class="break"> 2011 Admission Requirements </h2>

<p>Application details for Fall 2011 will be posted at a later date.</p>


<h2 class="break"> 2010 Admission Requirements </h2>	

<P>
Application to the MS program for Fall 2010 must be completed
<a href="https://app.applyyourself.com/?id=dart-grad">online</a>.
The deadline for submission of all application materials is <strong>January 8, 2010</strong>.

<h2 class="break"> Scholarships and Costs</h2>

<P>
Dartmouth College tuition for 2010-2011 will be set in early 2010 (tuition for 2009-2010 is $12,815 per term). At the discretion of the admissions committee, we may award 50% tuition for the first four terms, and 100% tuition for three more terms. Students also pay for the college health insurance plan, unless they have comparable insurance already. The insurance fee for 2010-2010 will be set in early 2010 (the fee for 2009-2010 is $1,654). Students are responsible for covering their living expenses, because the Masters program does not offer fellowships or stipends.
<P>
Note: Once they have been admitted, international students must
provide written certification of financial support for the MS
program. 
<P>

			<P>The required components of your application are:</P>

			<OL CLASS="req">
				<LI><a
				href="https://app.applyyourself.com/?id=dart-grad">The
				online application form</a>
				<LI>Three (3) letters of recommendation
				<LI>College transcripts
				<LI>GRE scores (photocopy accepted, original required upon admission)
				<LI>
				  TOEFL or IELTS scores (required for
				  non-native English speakers,
				  photocopy accepted, original
				  required upon admission)
				<LI>The $50 application fee
			</OL>

<P>
These items must reach us by January 8, 2010 in order for your application to receive full consideration.
<P>
Arrange for official transcripts to be sent to us from each college or university you have attended as a regular undergraduate or graduate student. They must arrive by January 8, 2010.
<P>
We require the General GRE. Your score report must reach us by January
9, 2010. If it will be late, you may send us a photocopy now and the
official report upon admission. We do not require the subject
GRE. However, if you do not have an academic degree in Computer
Science, we recommend the subject GRE in Computer Science, since it
demonstrates a certain level of preparation in the field. 
<P>
If English is not your native language, we require that you take the
TOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS
(International English Language Testing System exam). An IELTS band
score of 7.0 or above is required for Dartmouth Programs, but we have
no specific test score requirements for the TOEFL or GRE. If you are
transferring from a U.S. university, we may waive the language test.
As with the GRE, we will accept a photocopy until the official report
is available, but the photocopy must reach us by January 8, 2010.
<P>
We prefer that your recommenders give their recommendations
online. Once you have listed their names on the application, an email
will be sent to them with a link to the application site.  However, if
necessary, we will accept recommendations in sealed envelopes through
the mail. Recommendation letters from scientists in the same academic
and research communities as our departmental faculty will carry more
weight. 
<P>
We require a $50.00 application fee, to be paid by credit card
online. The fee helps to cover the cost of processing your application
and is non-refundable. The application fee will not be waived. 
<P>
Like many graduate programs, we base our admission decisions primarily
on the information requested above. We have no minimum test scores. We
recognize that you may have talents and experience that do not shine
through the forms and test scores.
<P>
Use the <em>Application Essay</em> section of the online application to
give additional information. Do you have a specific reason for coming
to Dartmouth? Specific goals for your study? Significant work
experience? Why do you want to do advanced training in computer
science? Include any publications you have authored (not to exceed 30
pages total). 
<P>
In the <em>Computer Science Supplement</em> section of the online
application, attach examples of your work. This is also the place
where you can attach a resume. 
<P>
There is no separate application for financial aid. Every applicant is
considered for financial aid, unless you say that you do not need
financial support. If you do not need support, please indicate this on
the application form, and tell us how you expect to be supported.
