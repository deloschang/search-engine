<p>
<a href="~cbk">Prof. Chris Bailey-Kellogg</a>

<p>How is oxygen carried around in blood, how are invaders recognized
by cells, and how is food digested?  <a
href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/molecules/molecule_list.html">Answers</a>
to these and other questions about the molecular machinery of the cell
(and potentially how to modify
it) center on analysis of three-dimensional protein structures.
We are embedding computation as a core component of structural
studies, planning experiments to maximize the information gained,
interpreting the results so as to characterize remaining uncertainty,
and iterating.  For example, reasoning by analogy to other proteins,
we can predict possible models for a new protein (see figure).  Then
we can analyze their differences (e.g., distances between landmarks,
overall envelopes, surface vs. core locations) and optimize
experimental probes for these differences, employing "multimodal" sets
of probes to overcome the noise and sparsity characteristics of any
individual experimental type.</p>

<p>
<a href="~cbk">Prof. Chris Bailey-Kellogg</a>

<p>Family reunions can be very interesting.  Proteins have relatives
(across organisms and even within the same organism) that are similar,
but also different in significant ways.  For example, shown in the
figure are one serine protease (blue; function is to chop up other
proteins) and one of its inhibitors (red; function is to block the
chopping mechanism, as shown).  Different proteases recognize
different places to chop, while different inhibitors have different
degrees of inhibition for different proteases.  We are developing
techniques to learn from nature's exploration of these families --
generalizing common features of observed family members and
characterizing their differences, and relating these to experimental
observations about their functions.  This enables us to optimize our
own new variants with desired functions (e.g., particularly strong and
protease-specific inhibitors).</p>

<p> <a href="~robotics">Prof. Devin Balkcom</a>


<p>

Thin materials like sheet metal, paper, and cardboard are lightweight, inexpensive, and can be stored and shipped in bulk.  Folding allows the construction of semi-rigid 3-D structures, including fast-food containers, paper bags, and file cabinets.  Folding can also allow a single large surface or chain to be stored in a small volume; motivating examples include car airbags, space-telescope mirrors, and proteins.  Finally, folding allows reconfiguration, without the need for disassembly and reassembly.  

<p>
We have built the first origami-folding robot (left), capable of folding a paper hat, paper airplane, and paper cup.  We have also analyzed more complicated folding techniques; work with Erik and Martin Demaine questions whether ordinary paper shopping bags can be  <a href="http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_07_25_05.html">mathematically folded</a>.

<p> <a href="~robotics">Prof. Devin Balkcom</a>


<p>


Robot control algorithms, like computer algorithms, allocate  resources to accomplish tasks; resources include time, energy, degrees of freedom, steps of computation, and precision.  A fundamental problem is to determine the minimum resources required -- the physical complexity of of the task.  The optimal trajectories provide insight into the capabilities of a mechanism, independent of compromises introduced by particular planning or control techniques.  

<p>
The exact optimal trajectories were previously known for two vehicles:  the Dubins car, and the Reeds-Shepp car.  We have discovered the optimal trajectories for a third vehicle; the common differential-drive (wheelchair-like) robot, and work on two more vehicles is nearing completion.

<p> <a href="/~campbell">Prof. Andrew Campbell</a>

<p>
The next big thing in networking, and arguably one of the most fascinating and coolest technologies
to hit the scene since the Internet, is wireless sensor networks. These tiny, low-cost wireless
devices embed on-board sensing, are fully programmable, and can spontaneously form large sensor webs
with thousands of distributed sensor devices. The potential of this fast-emerging field seems huge.

<p>
The <a href="http://sensorlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Sensor Networks Group</a> 
is focused on <a href="http://metrosense.cs.dartmouth.edu/">people-centric sensing</a> through the development 
of new networking protocols to make mobile sensor networks robust, scale-free, and flexible to program - in essence, to make these new networks useable for the future deployment of emerging people-centric sensing applications.

<img src="content/features_research/subballs.jpg"
     alt="Schematic" />


<p> <a href="~ac">Prof. Amit Chakrabarti</a>

<p> Nearest neighbour searching is one of those basic and fascinating
theoretical problems in computer science that has a host of applications
in problems from very diverse fields. The problem is widely believed to
be intractable in high dimensions, but good approximation algorithms
were discovered in the late 1990s.  </p>

<p> Our research considers the approximate nearest neighbour search
(ANNS) problem on the d-dimensional Hamming cube. Building on techniques
of information complexity and communication complexity from an earlier
research project of ours, we prove the <em>first unrestricted lower
bound</em> for this problem. We also improve previous algorithms for
this problem, ending up with <em>matching upper and lower bounds</em> on
the number of randomised queries required to solve ANNS.  </p>

<p> Shown in the figure is a schematic of the reduction bridging
communication complexity and ANNS, a key step in our proof. </p>

<p>
<a href="~tanzeem">Prof. Tanzeem Choudhury</a>

<p>

The structure and dynamics of social networks are of critical importance to
many social phenomena, ranging from organizational efficiency to the spread
of knowledge and disease. However, advances in modeling the <em>dynamics</em> of
social networks has been limited due to the lack of rich temporal data. By
developing new machine learning methods that can infer the structure and
dynamics of social networks from mobile sensor data, we are investigating
ways to unobtrusively study social interactions and networks over extended
periods of time. A deeper understanding of people's interactions will have
significant impacts, not only on the social science research literature,
but also enable the development of socially aware ubiquitous computing
systems that are cognizant of and responsive to users' engagement with
their social environment.

<p>
<a href="~tanzeem">Prof. Tanzeem Choudhury</a>

<p>

Systems that can capture and recognize human behaviors in unconstrained
real world settings have the potential to dramatically impact research in
smart environments, novel user interfaces, surveillance, and health care.
For these systems to be practical in the "real world" (i.e., outside of
research labs), they need to detect a variety of activities that are
performed routinely in many different manners, under many different
environmental conditions, and across many different individuals. We are
developing machine learning techniques for feature selection,
semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning in structured models, which can
handle the complexities of real world data, are computationally tractable,
and minimize the effort required from humans to train activity recognition
systems

<a href="~thc">Prof. Tom Cormen</a>

<p>

High-performance computing with disk-resident data?  Although that
might seem like an oxymoron, we are developing a software environment,
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/FG/">FG</a>, to enable it.

<p>

FG is for asynchronous programs that run on clusters and fit into a
pipeline framework.  Each pipeline stage corresponds to a function
that operates on a buffer.  Multiple buffers traverse the pipeline and
correspond to blocks in the memory hiearchy.  Stages run
asynchronously (via threads) in order to make it easy to overlap their
operations (computation, communication, and I/O).

<p>

Using FG, we have developed programs that can sort well in excess of
100 gigbytes of data.  (Image, left, shows Tom's whiteboard covered with deep thoughts about pipelines.)<h2 class="break">Brain Engineering</h2>

Our brains are the most complex objects known to man.  We cannot yet explain how our brains recognize, learn, plan, or use language.  Yet these tasks are so natural for us they seem effortless.  Through extensive interdisciplinary collaborations, the Brain Engineering Laboratory combines research from neuroscience, computer science, and cognitive science to advance our understanding of how brains operate.  We aim to understand brain circuits sufficiently well to be able to imitate their function.  We have extensive publications in this interdisciplinary field, as well as a range of applications that have been developed for medical and commercial uses.

<h2 class="break">Price and Allocation Algorithms for Markets and Networks</h2>


<img src="content/features_research/lkf-markets.png"
     alt="Price Allocation Algorithms" />

<p> <a href="~lkf">Prof. Lisa Fleischer</a>


<p>
We seek a better understanding of the behavior of
decentralized systems such as markets 
and traffic networks, through the study of effective 
resource allocation and price determination for these systems.

<h4>Markets:</h4>
Why might markets tend toward and remain near equilibrium
prices?  We assume that a collection
of more or less simple procedures 
underlie the actions of participants in the actual economy.  
We aim to explain why price changes in market economies might work 
effectively by showing simple distributed algorithms
that cause prices to converge quickly toward equilibrium values.
The goal of this work is to better understand price adjustment
mechanisms that operate independently on each price yet achieve 
a coordinated outcome.  

<h4>Network Traffic:</h4>
Individual network users may have an adverse impact on network 
performance, by acting in their own interests instead
of the aggregate interest.  We study 
equilibria of routing games to understand possible
outcomes of selfish routing decisions; and we anayze 
methods such as taxation, rerouting, network design and policy 
to try and control this.

<p>

We no longer live in a world where seeing (or hearing) is
believing.  The technology that allows for digital media to be
manipulated and distorted is developing at break-neck speeds.  And at
the same time, our understanding of the technological, ethical, and
legal implications is lagging behind.

<p>

We are, therefore, developing mathematical and computational
algorithms to detect tampering in digital media.  To do so, we
quantify statistical correlations that result from specific forms of
digital tampering, and devise detection schemes to reveal these
correlations.

<p>

It is ironic that the Ancient Egyptian tombs, once sealed, were not
intended to be seen by outsiders. Yet the highly valued and often
reproduced tomb decorations have had a profound influence on art and
have contributed significantly to our understanding of the Ancient
Egyptian culture. 

<p>

We describe how recent advances in computational and digital
technology can add a new perspective to these marvels of antiquity. Of
particular interest to us has been the development of a technique for
the digital reconstruction of tombs, allowing for the creation of
undistorted panoramic views of tomb interiors that are simply
unattainable with traditional imaging methods.

<p>

With the rise of Voice over wireless LAN (VoWLAN), any complete WiFi security solution must address denial of service attacks, such as kicking off other clients, consuming excessive bandwidth, or spoofing access points, to the detriment of legitimate clients. Even an authorized client may be able to sufficiently disrupt service quality to make the network ineffective for legitimate clients.

<p>

We take a three-point, MAP (Measure, Analyze, Protect) approach to develop an integrated and extensible framework to address existing and future attacks on WiFi networks. Specifically, we focus our efforts on an integrated set of new components that allow a WiFi network operator to measure and analyze WiFi and VoWLAN activity, and in real-time to identify and defend against MAC- and IP-layer attacks on that infrastructure. Our plan includes three overlapping phases: research, prototype development, and deployment on Dartmouth's campus-wide wireless network; the third phase is an option.

Digital technology plays an increasing role in everyday life, and this trend is only accelerating. Consider daily life five years from now, in 2010: we will each be surrounded by far more digital devices, mediating far more activities in our work, home, and play; the boundary between cyberspace and physical space will fade as sensors and actuators allow computers to be aware of, and control, the physical environment; and the devices in our life become increasingly (and often invisibly) interconnected with each other and with the Internet. Today, typical home users struggle to maintain the security of their home computer, and have difficulty managing their privacy online. Tomorrow, these challenges may become unimaginably complex. This 18-month project studies, and begins to address, the security and privacy challenges involved in developing this world of Digital Living in 2010.

<p> <a href="~sws">Prof. Sean Smith</a>

<p>


In a distributed world,
how can a stakeholder verify the identity
(or other relevant properties) of a remote party?

<p>

In the emerging information infrastructure,
multiple parties spanning multiple organizations have
various opinions about what they might trust, in what contexts.
To be effective,
the underlying mechanics for transmitting and expressing assertions 
about these parties
needs to be able to provide the right parameters to accommodate this 
multiplicity of views.
<p>

Because it can enable secure communications between parties who do not share a secret
beforehand, 
public key cryptography is a natural and perhaps unique building block.
Achieving this vision in
the real world, however, requires 
<i>public key infrastructure (PKI)</i>.  In our lab, we are exploring a number avenues to make PKI effective in the real world.

A <i>trusted third party (TTP)</i> can make it easier to solve multi-party security
problems.  However, using a TTP in a design has been akin 
to invoking magic or fairies: tools not possible in the real world.

<p>

However, in the last decade,  techniques have emerged
that can provide foundations for TTPs based in hardware.
In our lab, we are exploring ways of building effective 
trustworthy platforms founded on these techniques
and using these platforms for hardware-based TTPs
in real-world applications.

<img src="content/features_research/mcmc.jpg"
     alt="Widom-Rowlenson model" />


<p>
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/">Prof. Peter Winkler</a>

<p>

The basic problem in the Theory of Computing is do determine what kinds of problems can be efficiently solved by computer; in other words, what can algorithms do or not do.


<p>

In the 70's, theorists uncovered a wide range of "hard" decision and computation problems which are all intractable --- except in the (unlikely) event that they were all tractable!  Since then, exciting new techniques involving probabilistically checkable proofs have established that many quantities are as hard to approximate as they are to compute exactly.


<p>


Ironically, however, at about the same time theorists discovered a powerful mathematical tool which has greatly expanded the range of quantities which we <i> can </i> approximate efficiently.  Included are volumes of high-dimensional objects, partition functions in statistical physics, the permanent of a matrix, the number of linear extensions of an ordered set, generation of contingency tables (used by actuaries to compute insurance rates) and many more. The method, called MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo), entails randomly sampling the objects being counted by starting with a non-random object and moving to a random neighboring object.


<p>

The mathematical crux of this method is proving "rapid mixing", i.e., showing that the process reaches a random object in sufficiently short time.  Practically every branch of mathematics has contributed to the delightful variety of ways that have been devised to show rapid mixing in its many guises.


<p>

Shown in the picture is a configuration of the Widom-Rowlinson (WR) model of statistical physics, generated by MCMC.  The WR model simulates two gases (here, with red and green molecules), under the constraint that differing molecules may not occupy adjacent points on a grid.
