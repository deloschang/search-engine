<h1>Our BBQ Tour</h1>

In August 1998, Nicole and I went on a two-week BBQ tour of the south.
We visited BBQ restaurants, some famous and some not-so-famous,
throughout North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and even
West Virginia.  In all, we ate at 14 restaurants, one of which we ate
at twice.  Although that averages to only one place per day, we had
some intense BBQ days along with some non-BBQ days.

<p>

This page is a compilation of our impressions of the places we
visited, with photos of all but one.  (Our camera broke right in the
middle of our tour of Luray Caverns in Virginia, and so we didn't get
to take a photo of the last place we visited, which was in West
Virginia.)

<p>

We chose our BBQ destinations by several methods.
<ul>

  <li> The primary inspiration for the tour was the book <i>Smokestack
       Lightning</i> by Lolis Eric Elie.  He and photographer Frank Stewart
       visited BBQ joints from Chicago to Texas to Georgia.  They
       mentioned a few that we wanted to try.

  <li> We also used <i>Eat Your Way Across the USA</i> by Jane and
       Michael Stern.  We found that their recommendations sucked big time.
       The only place they recommended that we liked was <a
       href="dreamland.html">Dreamland</a> (Tuscaloosa, AL), and we had
       corroboration on that from Elie.  We also went to a couple of non-BBQ
       places they recommended and were thoroughly unimpressed.

  <li> We also took advice from H. Kent Craig's
       North Carolina BBQ page (I don't remember how I found it)
       and <a href="http://www.ipass.net/~lineback/bbq/jnts.htm">The
       Lexington Collection</a> (ditto).

  <li> I posted to alt.food.barbecue, asking for suggestions, and the BBQ
       mavens of that newsgroup sent a few responses.  Thanks to Bernie
       Spencer, Bill Loftin, Bill Bates, and Dan Brown.

  <li> We also took suggestions from folks we met along the way.

  <li> Sometimes we just stopped at a place that we were passing by.

  <li> And we were influenced by Hurricane Bonnie, which prevented us
       from visiting Wilbur's BBQ in Goldsboro, NC and Em-Ing's on
       the eastern shore of Maryland.  It sent us inland, where we
       completed the <a href="lexington.html">Lexington Six-Pack</a>.
       
</ul>

<p>

Here are the places, listed in the order we visited them, except that
I've lumped the six places in Lexington, NC together onto one page.
