<b>current position</b>
<p>
I am currently with the 
<a href = "http://www.deshaw.com">The D. E. Shaw Group</a>.  
<p>

<b>previous positions</b>
<p>
From Fall 2006 until the end of 2011, I was an Assistant Professor in
the 
<a href = "http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>
at 
<a href = "http://www.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>.  
I continued as an Adjunct Assistant Professor until June 2012.  
During the Fall of 2006, I was also a Research Professor at
<a href = "http://www.msri.org">MSRI</a>, where
I was part of the program titled 
<a href =
"http://www.msri.org/calendar/programs/ProgramInfo/243/show_program">
Computational Applications of Algebraic Topology</a>.
<p>
From January 2004 to June 2006, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in 
<a href = "http://biox.stanford.edu/">Bio-X</a> and the 
<a href = "http://www.cs.stanford.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>
at
<a href = "http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>.
I was in two groups:
the <a href = "http://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas">Leonidas Guibas Laboratory</a>
and
<a href = "http://math.stanford.edu/comptop/">TMSCSCS</a>.  
<p>
From July through December 2003, I was
away from Stanford, traveling
in five countries.
During that time, I was a guest researcher</a> at the
<a href = "http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/">Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Informatik</a> in 
<a href = "http://www.saarbruecken.de">Saarbr&uuml;cken</a>, 
Germany, for about five months, where I worked with
<a href = "http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/~kettner/">Lutz Kettner</a>.
<p>
From October 2001 through June 2003, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow
at Stanford.
<p>
<b>academic background</b>
<p>
I completed my Ph.D. in October 2001 from the 
<a href = "http://www.cs.uiuc.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>
at
<a href = "http://www.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign</a>.  
I was a <em>Visiting Scholar</em> in the 
<a href = "http://www.cs.duke.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>
at
<a href = "http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> from 1999 to 2001
during my graduate work.
<br>
<br>
Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the 
<a href = "http://www.cs.stanford.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>
at
<a href = "http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> in 1996.  I did
some research on color acquisition and automatic shape acquisition (part of
the <a href = "http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/faxing/">3D Fax
Project</a>) in the 
<a href = "http://graphics.stanford.edu">Stanford Computer Graphics
Laboratory</a> as an undergraduate.
<br>
<br>

I graduated from 

<a href = "http://www.iusd.org/uhs/">University High School</a>

in Irvine, California, in 1992, but I first spent three years in
<em>Rolling Hills High School</em>, which merged with Palos Verdes and
Miraleste High Schools to form

<a href = "http://www.pvphs.com">Palos Verdes 
Peninsula High School</a>

in 1991.  My family then moved to 
<a href = "http://www.irvinecompany.com">Irvine</a>.
