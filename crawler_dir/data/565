<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="   As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising
costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect
data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between
sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can
continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care.
Furthermore, individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and
managing their own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has
addressed security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors
remains a challenge.
   We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth sensing
protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties with low
energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses
three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify
transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even
for small-sized MACs; and an asymmetric resource requirement. Second,
we demonstrate a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluate it
experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy
analysis of our system.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
   As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising
costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect
data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between
sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can
continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care.
Furthermore, individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and
managing their own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has
addressed security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors
remains a challenge.
</P><P>
   We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth sensing
protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties with low
energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses
three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify
transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even
for small-sized MACs; and an asymmetric resource requirement. Second,
we demonstrate a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluate it
experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy
analysis of our system.
