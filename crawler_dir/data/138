		<h1> Graduate Student Life </h1>	

<h2 class="break"> The Location </h2>	

<p>
<a href="http://www.hanovernh.org">Hanover</a> lies along the eastern
bank of the Connecticut River, between the Green Mountains of <a
href="http://www.vtliving.com">Vermont</a> and the <a
href="../whites">White Mountains</a> of <a
href="http://www.visitnh.gov">New Hampshire</a>.  Hanover is a small
town (about 9, 200 residents) whose major employers are Dartmouth
College and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.&nbsp; The downtown
area, consisting of about four square blocks of shops, is right next
to the College.&nbsp; Hanover has tried hard to preserve the
traditional New England small-town qualities; there are no big
shopping malls or fast food restaurants.&nbsp; The same holds for
Norwich, Vermont, just across the river.&nbsp; <p><img SRC="images/cover.jpg"
NOSAVE height=260 width=221 align=LEFT>The neighboring towns of
Lebanon and West Lebanon in New Hampshire, and White River Junction in
Vermont, are slightly larger and offer more in the way of
consumerism.&nbsp; All the other towns in the area are quite small,
and the local general store still thrives.&nbsp; The area is served by
one local newspaper, several radio stations, and a television
station.&nbsp; Boston TV is available on cable in most towns, along
with the usual array of movie and sports channels.  <p>Amid such rural
beauty, it is not surprising that mountain climbing, cross-country
skiing, canoeing, and hiking are popular activities.&nbsp; The
Dartmouth Outing Club maintains hiking and ski trails all over New
Hampshire, and the Appalachian Trail actually goes right through
downtown Hanover.&nbsp; The Outing Club leads hikes, bike rides, canoe
trips, and ski trips all year round.


<h2 class="break">Housing </h2>


<p>
College housing for married graduate students is available at
<b>Sachem Village</b>, a complex of 132 one, two, and three-bedroom
apartments about a mile and a half from campus.&nbsp; These apartments
are unfurnished except for an electric stove and refrigerator.&nbsp;
Couples interested in living at Sachem Village should write to
the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dartmouthre.com/">Office of
Rental Housing</a>, <u>14 South Main Street, Suite 2D, Hanover,
NH&nbsp; 03755</u>.&nbsp; When requesting housing at Sachem Village it
is best to write as soon as possible, since requests are honored in
order of their date of filing.&nbsp; <p>Many single students find
private accommodations in the Hanover area.&nbsp; The Office of Rental
Housing (see address above) maintains a file of rooms, apartments, and
houses for rent, both in Hanover and in nearby towns.&nbsp; If you own
a car, you may want to live outside of Hanover where the rents are
lower.

<h2 class="break"> Health Care </h2>


<p>
Each full-time student is entitled to health care services at Dick's House, on Rope Ferry Road (an extension of North Main Street).  Coverage for the fall term starts September 1, and for other terms, on the day before registration; coverage lasts until registration day for the following term, or until your enrollment is terminated by withdrawal, suspension, or separation.
All students must either purchase the Dartmouth Student Group Insurance Plan (DS-GHIP), or certify through a waiver application that they are already covered by comparable insurance.  The DS-GHIP must be purchased for a full twelve-month year with two exceptions:  (1) those students whose waiver ceases to be valid must purchase the group insurance at that time; (2) all students with accepted waivers that enroll in the Dartmouth Foreign Study Program are required to purchase the DS-GHIP for the terms they are engaged in these programs.  In both cases the charges are prorated.

<h2 class="break"> Activities </h2>


<p>
Dartmouth offers a modest but active cultural life.&nbsp; The <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~hop/">Hopkins Center</a> at Dartmouth
is a magnet for the arts in New Hampshire and Vermont; it sponsors
concerts by visiting and local musicians, film series, art shows, and
theater.&nbsp; The Hop also has workshops for woodworking, sculpture,
painting and crafts.&nbsp; The Hood Museum features a good art
collection, and the building itself has aroused interest in the
architectural community.&nbsp; The local populace includes a high
percentage of enthusiastic musicians, thespians, terpsichores, and
crafts people; it's easy to find a string quartet or a contradance.
<p><img SRC="images/ski.jpg" NOSAVE height=150 width=198>The
College provides the usual assortment of <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~athfac">gyms</a>, basketball courts,
tennis courts, squash courts, weight rooms, aerobics classes, swimming
pools, and baseball diamonds, as well as a hockey rink, an indoor
track, and a golf course.&nbsp; Dartmouth students are traditionally
active athletes, and there are plenty of opportunities for spectators
and participants.  <p>If you want to travel, there are two major
highways within five miles of campus, I-89 and I-91.&nbsp; The former
will get you to Boston in about two and a half hours or Montreal in
three and a half, and the latter leads to New York City in five
hours.&nbsp; Vermont Transit provides bus service to all three cities,
with stops in Hanover or White River Junction.&nbsp; Amtrak stops in
White River on its way to New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington.&nbsp; The Lebanon airport is served by U.S. Air Express
with direct flights to Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.&nbsp;</ul>
