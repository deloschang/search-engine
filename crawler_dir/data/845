<h1>Champion International Professorship
       in Honor of Andrew C. Sigler '53 Tuck '56</h1>

"The Champion International Professorship is established at Dartmouth
College by Champion International Corporation to honor its retiring
Chief Executive Officer Andrew C. Sigler, a member of the Dartmouth
class of 1953 and Tuck School Class of 1956. Through its distinction
it confers upon its successive holders, the professorship is intended
to recognize and reward members of the Dartmouth faculty whose
teaching is true to the highest standards of Dartmouth's educational
mission and whose scholarship has contributed to the advancement of
knowledge in their chosen fields. As a fitting tribute to Mr. Sigler's
character and career, it is the hope of the Donor that the holders of
the Champion International Professorship will continue Dartmouth's
tradition of independence, inquisitiveness, and accomplishment in the
advancement of knowledge and the education of future generations of
leaders."
